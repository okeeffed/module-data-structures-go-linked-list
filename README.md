2. getFirst: Fetch the first node
3. getLast: Fetch the last node
4. clear: Remove all node
5. removeFirst: Remove head of list

8. getAt: Fetch node at index
9. removeAt: Remove node at index
10. insertAt: Insert at index
11. forEach: Iterate through list and run function on list

Tips:

- Create a list that had a head, size and lock property
- Create a node that holds some form of data and has another property pointing to another node

## getFirst

Return a pointer to the first node.
