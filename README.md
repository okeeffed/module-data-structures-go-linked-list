Generating a basic Linked List.

Creates a `node` with data and a link.

Functions for the list include:

1. insertFirst: Insert at the head of list
2. size: Fetch list length
3. getFirst: Fetch the first node
4. getLast: Fetch the last node
5. clear: Remove all node
6. removeFirst: Remove head of list
7. removeLast: Remove last node
8. insertLast: Insert at end of list
9. getAt: Fetch node at index
10. removeAt: Remove node at index
11. insertAt: Insert at index
12. forEach: Iterate through list and run function on list

## insertFirst

Tips:

- Create a list that had a head, size and lock property
- Create a node that holds some form of data and has another property pointing to another node
